# AlgoRun Website


## NOTE
As of the current version of the website, all functionalities are implemented in the front-end. If you are going to update some website content, you DON'T need to install any dependencies; edit files in the web folder directly (links in the nav-bar won't work).


## Install Dependencies

+ [Install nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

+ Update node package manager:
`sudo npm install npm -g`

+ Install website dependencies. From this directory:
`sudo npm install`
