# What is OCSANA+?

OCSANA+ is a Cytoscape app for identifying potential driver nodes, prioritizing combinations ofinterventions, and simulating the effects of node perturbations in biological networks. OCSANA+ includes an update to OCSANA (optimal combinations of interventions from network analysis),  structure-based controllability algorithms for non-linear systems and an algorithm for estimating the signal flow through anetwork based on the networkâ€™s topology. OCSANA+ provides researchers a tool to identify and simulate perturbations to key molecular targets within large scale complex signaling network.
