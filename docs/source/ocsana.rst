 Computing Optimal Combinations of Intervention with OCSANA
=======

OCSANA (Optimal Combinations of Interventions from Network Analysis), originally introduced in (Vera-Licona et al., 2013), identifies and prioritizes optimal minimal combinations of interventions (CIs) that disrupt the elementary paths from selected source nodes to the specified target nodes. When indicated by the user, OCSANA seeks to additionally minimize the side-effects that CIs can cause on specified off-target nodes.
